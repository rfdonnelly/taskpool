== Alternative to StreamExt::buffer_unordered

This is an alternative approach to https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.buffer_unordered[StreamExt::buffer_unordered].

I originally thought that buffer_unordered could not be chained.
This post https://gendignoux.com/blog/2021/04/01/rust-async-streams-futures-part1.html[Asynchronous streams in Rust (part 1) - Futures, buffering and mysterious compilation error messages] suggests otherwise.
